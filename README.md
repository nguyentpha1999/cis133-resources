# cis133-resources
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/html-css-and-javascript-explained-for-beginners/, I believe this is a really good resources link for beginneers because everything is immaculate. It also show example on top of describing what the coding is.
https://www.w3schools.com/html/, this another resources I found really useful, because it have table of content for each of the coding languages which can be easier to access and study. Therefore, having table of content will help you find your resources easier incase you lose it in the middle of studying.
